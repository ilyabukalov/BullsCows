This is AI for famous number game [Bulls and Cows](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bulls_and_Cows).
It was written in 2007 when I was young making my first steps in programming (so don't judge me for quality).
it was originally written in Python as console application and later I translated it into Java to make it compatible with mobile devices.

**To build mobile version:**
```
./build.bat
```

**To run console version:**
```
cd src
run_console.bat
```
